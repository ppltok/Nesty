## User Activation Analysis

**Last run:** 2026-05-27 · **Script:** `node analysis/run.js` → outputs `analysis/dashboard.html`

### Segment definitions
| Segment | Definition |
|---------|-----------|
| **Nonactive** | 0 items added |
| **Newbies** | 1–4 items added |
| **Pros** | 5+ items added |

### Snapshot (2026-05-27, 321 users)
| Segment | Users | % |
|---------|-------|---|
| Nonactive | 188 | 59% |
| Newbies | 91 | 28% |
| Pros | 42 | 13% |

### Key findings
- **59% of users never added a single item** — signed up and disappeared
- **Pros completed onboarding 100%** vs 86% for nonactives — onboarding completion is the strongest predictor of activation
- **83% of users who added anything did so within the first hour** — almost entirely a one-session product
- **Pros spread across 6+ stores** (67% of pros); newbies mostly shop at 1 store (64%)
- **Checklist nudge email: 0 conversions** from 32 sends; 12 were mis-targeted (already had items)
- **Abandon email: only 2 ever sent** — trigger is barely firing, needs investigation
- **Partner linking is rare** even for pros (14%) — untapped engagement lever
- **Facebook is the dominant traffic source** (189 users, 13% pro rate); Instagram converts slightly better (18%)
- **Direct/Unknown (35 users): 0% pro rate** — likely low-intent or bot traffic

### Dashboard charts
1. Distribution by signup month
2. Monthly data table
3. Distribution by traffic source
4. Traffic source data table
5. Onboarding drop-off funnel (with segment filter)
6. Profile completeness signals
7. Store diversity — stores per user
8. Top 10 stores by items added
9. Time from signup to first item added
10. Days between first & last item (session spread)
11. Checklist nudge email effect
12. Abandon email effect

### How to re-run
```bash
node analysis/run.js
# then open analysis/dashboard.html in browser
```
Fetches live data from Supabase and recomputes all metrics. No hardcoded values.

## Project Overview

Nesty is a baby registry web application with a Chrome extension that allows expecting parents to add products from any e-commerce website to their registry.

**Components:**
- **Web Application:** React-based registry management (deployed at https://ppltok.github.io/Nesty)
- **Chrome Extension:** Product scraper for adding items from any online store

## Major Technical Discoveries

### 🎯 Extension Architecture: JSON-LD vs DOM Scraping (December 21, 2024)

**Discovery:** We identified two fundamentally different approaches to product extraction in our codebase, with dramatically different results.

#### Comparison

| Approach | Location | Method | Accuracy | Code Complexity |
|----------|----------|--------|----------|-----------------|
| **JSON-LD Extraction** | `extension/final-version/` | Structured data parsing | ✅ Very High | Simple (150 lines) |
| **DOM Scraping** | `extension/nesty-local/` | CSS selector-based | ❌ Unreliable | Complex (122KB obfuscated) |

#### JSON-LD Approach (WINNER) ✅

**File:** `extension/final-version/content.js`

**How it works:**
```javascript
// Searches for structured JSON-LD data in the page
const jsonLdScripts = document.querySelectorAll('script[type="application/ld+json"]');

// Parses standard Product schema
if (data['@type'] === 'Product') {
  return extractFromProduct(data);
}

// Parses ProductGroup schema (for variants)
if (data['@type'] === 'ProductGroup') {
  return extractFromProductGroup(data);
}
```

**Advantages:**
- ✅ **Accuracy:** Extracts exact price and correct product image
- ✅ **Reliability:** Works across different e-commerce platforms (Shopify, WooCommerce, etc.)
- ✅ **Standardized:** Uses schema.org Product/ProductGroup standards
- ✅ **Maintainable:** Clean, readable code
- ✅ **Handles variants:** Correctly handles ProductGroup for products with variants (e.g., different sizes/colors)

**Example structured data:**
```json
{
  "@type": "Product",
  "name": "בקבוק נטורל ריספונס",
  "image": ["https://example.com/product.jpg"],
  "offers": {
    "price": "59.90",
    "priceCurrency": "ILS"
  }
}
```

**Real-world result:** Correctly extracted 59.90 ILS (not 159.90)

---

#### DOM Scraping Approach (DEPRECATED) ❌

**File:** `extension/nesty-local/assets/babylistScraper.js`

**How it works:**
- Uses CSS selectors to find elements: `document.querySelector('.price')`
- Generic scraping framework with selector-based extraction
- Tries to guess which elements contain price/image data

**Problems:**
- ❌ **Wrong prices:** Often grabs sale price, shipping costs, or currency symbols instead of actual price
- ❌ **Too many images:** Returns long list of ALL images on page (thumbnails, banners, logos, icons)
- ❌ **Site-dependent:** Different sites use different class names, making it unreliable
- ❌ **Complex:** 122KB of obfuscated code that's hard to maintain

**Real-world result:** Extracted wrong price (159.90 instead of 59.90) and returned dozens of irrelevant images

---

#### Technical Explanation: Why JSON-LD is Superior

**JSON-LD (Linked Data):**
- Standard format recommended by Google for SEO
- Most modern e-commerce platforms (Shopify, WooCommerce, Magento) automatically include it
- Structured, predictable format - like reading a database
- Contains authoritative product information

**DOM Scraping:**
- Tries to visually interpret the page like a human would
- Fragile - breaks when sites change their HTML structure
- Guesswork - has to assume which element is the "real" price
- No guarantee of accuracy

**Analogy:**
- **JSON-LD:** Reading product data from a spreadsheet (structured)
- **DOM Scraping:** Taking a screenshot and trying to guess which numbers are prices (unstructured)

---

#### Decision: Use JSON-LD Extraction

**Status:** ✅ Implemented in `extension/final-version/`

**Rationale:**
1. Significantly more accurate price and image extraction
2. Works reliably across different e-commerce platforms
3. Simpler, more maintainable codebase
4. Better handles product variants (ProductGroup schema)
5. Industry-standard approach used by major extensions

**Implementation Details:**
- Supports both `Product` and `ProductGroup` schemas
- Handles variants by extracting from first variant's offers
- Collects unique images from all variants
- Falls back gracefully if no structured data found

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Structured Data is Superior for Web Scraping
- JSON-LD provides reliable, accurate product data
- DOM scraping is fragile and unreliable
- Industry standards (schema.org) exist for a reason

### 2. Chrome Web Store Permissions
- Broad host permissions cause delayed review
- Use `activeTab` instead whenever possible
- Be transparent about why each permission is needed

### 3. Extension Architecture
- Background scripts need full Chrome API access
- Content scripts have limited permissions
- Use message passing to coordinate between contexts

### 4. Authentication in Extensions
- Can't access cross-origin localStorage directly
- Use `chrome.tabs` API to query specific tabs
- Execute scripts in target tab's context to read session
- Cache session in `chrome.storage` for performance
